# UndergradThesis
Contains the scripts and Unity project for my undergraduate thesis, "Novice-Level Implementations of Cellular Automata for the Purpose of Data Manipulation"

Code can be found in .cs files within CellularAutomata/Assets/Scripts.
The script ConwayBool is fully documented and explains the implementation of the algorithm thoroughly.
